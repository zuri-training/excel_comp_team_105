<!-- CONTRIBUTING -->
## CONTRIBUTING

To contribute, follow the steps below:

<ol>

<li>

- #### Fork the project repository

Locate the project's repository on GitHub, and then "fork" it by clicking the Fork button in the upper right corner.
</li>

<li>

- #### Clone your fork
While still in your repository, click the green Clone or download button and then copy the HTTPS URL.

Using Git on your local machine, clone your fork using the URL you just copied: git clone URL_OF_FORK.

</li>

<li>

- #### Add the project repository as the "upstream" remote

Add the project repository as the "upstream" remote using: git remote add upstream URL_OF_PROJECT.

Use git remote -v to check that you now have two remotes: an origin that points to your fork, and an upstream that points to the project repository.
</li>

<li>

- #### Pull the latest changes from upstream into your local repository

Use git pull upstream master to "pull" any changes from the "master" branch of the "upstream" into your local repository. (If the project repository uses "main" instead of "master" for its default branch, then you would use git pull upstream main instead.)

</li>

<li>

- #### Create a new branch

Use git checkout -b BRANCH_NAME to create a new branch and then immediately switch to it. The name of the branch should briefly describe what you are working on, and should not contain any spaces.
</li>

<li>

- #### Make changes in your local repository 
Using an text editor or IDE.

</li>

<li>

- #### Commit your changes
After you make a set of changes, use git add -A to stage your changes and git commit -m "DESCRIPTION OF CHANGES" to commit them.
</li>

<li>

- #### Push your changes to your fork

Upload these changes to your fork using git push origin BRANCH_NAME. This "pushes" your changes to the "BRANCH_NAME" branch of the "origin" (which is your fork on GitHub).
</li>

<li>

- #### Begin the pull request

Return to your fork on GitHub, and refresh the page. Click the green Compare & pull request button to begin the pull request. Alternatively, you can switch to your branch using the Branch button and then click the New pull request button. 
</li>

<li>

- #### Create the pull request

Below the pull request form, you will see a list of the commits you made in your branch, as well as the "diffs" for all of the files you changed.

If everything looks good, click the green Create pull request button!
</li>

<li>

- #### Synchronize your fork with the project repository

At this point, your fork is out of sync with the project repository's master branch.

To get it back in sync, you should first use Git to pull the latest changes from "upstream" (the project repository) into your local repository: git pull upstream master.

Then, push those changes from your local repository to the "origin" (your fork): git push origin master.
</li>
</ol>
